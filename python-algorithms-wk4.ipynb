    "Given a Bloom filter with $m = 100000$ bits and $k = 5$ hash functions that  map each key uniformly at random to one of the bits (assumption), estimate the probability that $k$ bits $i_1, \\ldots, i_k$ are simultaneously set when $n = 10000$ words are inserted. Assume that whether or not a particular bit is set is independent of another."
